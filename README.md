Chinese vocabulary memorisation app

Most language learning flashcard apps don't work well for Chinese.

Because the Chinese language has no alphabet, you need to learn the pronunciation, meaning and character for each word.
As regular flashcards only have two sides, you end up placing two of these categories on the same page, meaning you don't 
effectively learn the link between them.

This app will test you on:

Do you know the pinyin from the characters?
Do you know the meaning from the characters?
Do you know the meaning from the pinyin?
Do you know the pinyin from the meaning?

By testing connections between these three properties of Chinese words, you will be more comfortable using them in both a
written and spoken context.

Simply enter the Chinese words you wish to learn, add them to your dictionary and then begin testing. Once you are comfortable
with a word it will be sent to another word bank, which you will again be tested on once enough time has passed.
